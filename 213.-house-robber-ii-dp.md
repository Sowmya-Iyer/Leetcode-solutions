# 213. House Robber II - DP

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [2,3,2]
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
</strong></code></pre>

```python
class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums)==1:
            return nums[0]
        
        def dfs(nums):
            choose1=choose2=0
            for n in nums:
                temp=max(choose1+n,choose2)
                choose1=choose2
                choose2=temp
            return temp
        return max(dfs(nums[1:]),dfs(nums[:-1]))
```
