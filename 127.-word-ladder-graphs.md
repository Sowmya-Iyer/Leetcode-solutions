# 127. Word Ladder - Graphs

A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

* Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
* Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
* `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or_ `0` _if no such sequence exists._

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
</strong><strong>Output: 5
</strong><strong>Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
</strong><strong>Output: 0
</strong><strong>Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
</strong></code></pre>
