# 322. Coin Change - DP

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
</strong></code></pre>

```python
class Solution(object):
    def coinChange(self, coins, amount):
        """
        :type coins: List[int]
        :type amount: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        dp=[amount+1]*(amount+1)
        dp[0]=0
        for i in range(amount+1):
            for c in coins:
                if i-c >=0:
                    dp[i]=min(dp[i],1+dp[i-c])
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount]!=amount+1 else -1
```
