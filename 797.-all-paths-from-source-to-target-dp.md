# 797. All Paths From Source to Target - DP

Given a directed acyclic graph (**DAG**) of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` and return them in **any order**.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `graph[i][j]`).

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
</strong><strong>Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
</strong></code></pre>

```python
class Solution(object):
    def allPathsSourceTarget(self, graph):
        """
        :type graph: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        
        last=len(graph)-1
        def dfs(i,path,result):
            if i==last:
                result.append(path)
            for j in graph[i]:
                dfs(j,path+[j],result)
        
        result=[]
        dfs(0,[0],result)
        return result
```
