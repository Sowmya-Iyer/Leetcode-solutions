# 133. Clone Graph

Given a reference of a node in a [**connected**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity\_\(graph\_theory\)#Connected\_graph) undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object\_copying#Deep\_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

&#x20;

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

<pre><code><strong>Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
</strong><strong>Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
</strong>1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

```python
class Solution(object):
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        """
        :type node: Node
        :rtype: Node
        """

        if not node:
            return None
        
        new={}

        def dfs(node):
            if node in new:
                return new[node]

            dup = Node(node.val)
            new[node]=dup

            for n in node.neighbors:
                dup.neighbors.append(dfs(n))
            return dup
        return dfs(node)
