# 743. Network Delay Time

You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`, where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return _the **minimum** time it takes for all the_ `n` _nodes to receive the signal_. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**
