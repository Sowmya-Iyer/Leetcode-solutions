# 210. Course Schedule II - Graphs

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

* For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return _the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses_. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
</strong><strong>Output: [0,1]
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
</strong><strong>Output: [0,2,1,3]
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
</strong>So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
</code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
</strong><strong>Output: [0]
</strong></code></pre>
