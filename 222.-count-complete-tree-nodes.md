# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to [**Wikipedia**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary\_tree#Types\_of\_binary\_trees), every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
</strong><strong>Output:
</strong> 6</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code>Input: root = []
<strong>Output:
</strong> 0</code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code>Input: root = [1]
<strong>Output:
</strong> 1</code></pre>

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
         count=0
         if root:
            count+=1
            if root.left:
                count+= self.countNodes(root.left)      
            if root.right:
                count+= self.countNodes(root.right)
            # if not root.left and root.right:
            #     count+=1
         return count
```
