# 200. Number of Islands - Graphs

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: grid = [
</strong>  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
<strong>Output: 1
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: grid = [
</strong>  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
<strong>Output: 3
</strong></code></pre>

```python

        if not grid:
            return 0
        
        rows, cols= len(grid),len(grid[0])

                        (r,c) not in seen and grid[r][c] == '1'):
                        q.append((r,c))
